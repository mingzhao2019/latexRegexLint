# Agent Instructions

## Read First (required)
1) docs/DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md
2) CHANGELOG.md
3) README.md and README.zh.md (usage + examples)
4) package.json (configuration schema)
5) src/extension.ts (implementation)

## Working Convention
- After making changes, append a short entry to docs/DEVLOG.md with date and a 2–5 bullet summary.
- Keep DEVLOG entries concise and implementation-focused.
- Do not edit CHANGELOG.md manually; it is updated by the release workflow.
